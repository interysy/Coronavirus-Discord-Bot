<h1 align  = "center" >Coronavirus-Discord-Bot </h1> 
 
<p> Project built in summer of 2021 after my first year at University, with the intent of easy access to recent coronavirus numbers without leaving Discord for my friend group server. This bot was made using Python, Discord Py Library, BeautifulSoup 4 and Selenium. Alongside displaying values per country, it also allows server shortlising up to 10 countries and changing the command prefix. For all commands simply call (command prefix)help. </p>

## Before running on your own machine 
If you wish to run the bot yourself (with or without changes), firstly create a bot on the Discord Developer portal and copy the generated token. Next create a 'secrets.env' file in the root directory of the project and make DISCORD_TOKEN within that file equal to the copied token. 
 
<br> 

## To run
Simply run the botLauncher.py file and wait until bot is ready, along with country and general cog. Once this has been printed in the console, commands can be issued to the server (make sure to invite the bot to the correct server and grant necessary permissions).
